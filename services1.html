        <div class="introparagraphforservices">Does public speaking make you nervous? It tends to make everyone nervous. Imagine if we caught students before bad habits developed, before they learned to fear it. With <b>Confident Classrooms</b> students will learn behaviors that will last a lifetime. They will begin to see speaking as an opportunity and not a threat.<br><br> According to ELA State Standards for Speaking and Listening, all students are expected to become effective communicators. These standards are "designed to prepare students for life outside the classroom"*. However, students often don't have the strategies to be successful. This is where <b>Confident Classrooms</b> can help your students find success. Teachers will value the concrete approach that they can integrate into their already existing curriculum.<br> *<a href="http://www.corestandards.org/ELA-Literacy/" target="_blank">See ELA Standards</a>
<br><br> 
<b>Confident Classrooms</b> offers workshops targeted for teacher and staff development, as well as direct classroom instruction for students at every grade level. Whole class and small group instruction (ideal for English Language Learners)<br> and parent workshops are available.</div>

                    <p>These workshops are meant to be a compliment to the workshops happening in the classrooms with students. Parents will leave the workshop with the ability to facilitate the practice in everyday situations outside of school to continue what theyâ€™ve been learning. They will learn how they can encourage public speaking skills in their kids for school and life.  </p>
