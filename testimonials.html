She spoke in a loud clear voice and made eye contact with the class. She was able to speak about her topic without having to always look at her box. I was very impressed.”<br> <b>Keith B.</b> <br> <i>4<sup>th</sup> Grade Teacher</i></p><hr width="30%" class="test" color="#66CBD1" height="4px"><p class="spacingfort">"I appreciated the experience both for my students and myself.
