One of my students who has a particularly soft voice that trails into silence has been willing to speak out with greater volume. This makes such a difference for her!”</p><p class="spacingfort">“My class spoke with more confidence<br> after working with Amy.”</p><p class="spacingfort">“When Adriana did her bio box presentation it was obvious that she had rehearsed. She spoke in a loud clear voice and made eye contact with the class. She was able to speak about her topic without having to always look at her box.<br> I was very impressed.”</p><p class="spacingfort">"Students will explain their thinking using<br> evidence and elaboration."</p><p class="spacingfortspecial">"I appreciated the experience both for my students and myself. We have all benefited from these techniques<br> and Amy's excellent facilitation."</p></div></div>
