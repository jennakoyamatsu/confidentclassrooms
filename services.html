        <div class="introparagraphforservices">Does public speaking make you nervous? It tends to make everyone nervous. Imagine if we caught students before bad habits developed, before they learned to hate it. With <b>Confident Classrooms</b> students will learn behaviors that will last a lifetime. They will begin to see speaking as an opportunity and not a threat. According to ELA State Standards for Speaking and Listening, all students are expected to become effective communicators*. However, students often don't have the strategies to be successful. This is where Confident Classrooms can help your students find success. <a href="url">www.ccss.ela-literacy</a>
<br><br> 
<b>Confident Classrooms</b> offers workshops targeted for teacher and staff development, as well as direct classroom instruction for students at every grade level. Whole class and small group instruction (ideal for English Language Learners) and parent workshops are available.</div>
